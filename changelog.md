Complete rework.
Replaced the 'column' class with the new 'table' class that provides
all the functionality of rendering a table of subnets surrounding the
so-called 'base subnet'. This 'base subnet' is defined by the position
of the so-called 'focus', which is just a point in the so-called 'IP
table space'. This 'IP table space' is a two-dimensional space, one of
the dimension of which represents the subnets masks, and the other
dimension represents their addresses.
